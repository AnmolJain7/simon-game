# Simon Game

A simple memory-based game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The player must remember and repeat a sequence of colors that grows with each level.

# Demo

You can play the game by opening the index.html file in your browser.

# How to Play

Press any key to start the game.

The game will flash a button in a sequence.

Click the buttons in the same order as they appeared.

If you repeat the sequence correctly, you move to the next level.

If you make a mistake, the game ends, and you can restart by pressing any key.

Your high score is displayed after each game over.
